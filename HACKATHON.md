# Hackathon Compliance Statement

This repository was created and developed specifically for this hackathon.

The purpose of this document is to clearly state how this project complies with
the hackathon rules regarding originality, from-scratch development, and AI usage.

## Repository Origin

- This repository was created during the official hackathon period.
- All commits were made within the hackathon time window.
- No prior repositories, branches, or commit history were reused.

This repository is fully independent from any previous or existing projects.

## From-Scratch Development

The following rules were strictly followed:

- No pre-existing repositories were reused
- No prior deployments were reused
- No prior demo links were reused
- No existing codebases were copied into this repository
- No previous hackathon or production code was referenced in submission

All smart contracts, frontend components, and demo logic were written
from scratch specifically for this hackathon.

## Scope Limitation (Intentional)

To ensure compliance and feasibility within the hackathon timeframe,
the project scope was intentionally limited.

The following were deliberately excluded:

- Production infrastructure
- Full indexing or data pipelines
- Real airdrop or reward execution
- Any existing IndexFlow production components

This project focuses solely on demonstrating the core concept:
deterministic, ENS-aware proof-of-usage generation.

## AI Usage Disclosure

AI tools were used in a limited and transparent manner:

- UI scaffolding
- Non-critical helper logic
- Documentation assistance

AI tools were NOT used for:

- Deterministic proof logic
- Smart contract core logic
- Eligibility or scoring determinism

The proof logic is entirely deterministic and reproducible without AI.

Full details are provided in AI_ATTRIBUTION.md.

## Demo and Submission

The submission includes:

- This repository
- A hackathon-specific demo deployment
- A demo video recorded during the hackathon
- Documentation explaining design and limitations

No external or pre-existing demos were referenced.

## Final Statement

This project was built in good faith and in full compliance with
the hackathon rules.

All design decisions, scope limitations, and disclosures were made
to ensure transparency, fairness, and reproducibility.

If further clarification is needed, we are happy to provide it.
