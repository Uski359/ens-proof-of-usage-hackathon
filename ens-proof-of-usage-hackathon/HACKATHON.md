# Hackathon Statement

This repository was created from scratch for the hackathon. No existing codebase, boilerplate repo, or prior project was copied. All files and logic were authored specifically for this submission.

## Scope Limitations for Check-in 1
- Only a single ENS or wallet input is supported.
- Deterministic proof hash, score, and tags are generated from the resolved address.
- Multi-wallet tables, CSV export, and advanced scoring are explicitly deferred to Check-in 2 and are not implemented here.
