# AI Attribution

AI assistance was used for UI scaffolding, documentation drafts, and small non-critical helper structure. The deterministic proof logic (hash, score, tags) and ENS resolution behavior were explicitly specified and implemented without AI-driven inference. AI was not used to generate or modify proof outputs at runtime.
