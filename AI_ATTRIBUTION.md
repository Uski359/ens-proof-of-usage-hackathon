# AI Attribution Statement

This project was developed during a hackathon where the use of AI tools is permitted
with proper disclosure.

## AI Usage Scope

AI tools were used in a limited and transparent manner for the following purposes:

- UI scaffolding and layout assistance
- Non-critical helper code
- Documentation drafting and formatting

## AI Exclusions

AI tools were NOT used for:

- Deterministic proof generation
- Smart contract core logic
- ENS resolution logic
- Eligibility evaluation or scoring determinism

All proof-related logic is deterministic, reproducible, and verifiable
without the use of AI.

## Human Oversight

All AI-assisted outputs were reviewed, modified, and validated by the project author.

The final implementation decisions, architecture, and logic
were made entirely by the human developer.

## Final Note

AI usage in this project does not affect the correctness, determinism,
or reproducibility of the generated proofs.
